using machine learning
Idea is to use pattern of the signals from various source for example siesmograph signal.
suppose i train my machine learning model with the signals which are prior to actual earthquake, earthquake at different times and considering  siesmograph signals at that time prior to earthquakes.
so in case the real time signal is trending in the same pattern as of the pattern which was observed in the data available, the we can predict the upcoming value from the siesmograph.
so its identiying pattern of the realtime signl using machine learning.
The machine learning model is trained with the data of siesmograph signals which were noted prior to every earthquake
the same can be used to predict other disasters also.
* thhis can be improvised using adaptive learning to increace efficiency.
